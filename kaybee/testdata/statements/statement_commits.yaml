  text: Apache Karaf kar deployer reads .kar archives and extracts the paths from
    the "repository/" and "resources/" entries in the zip file. It then writes out
    the content of these paths to the Karaf repo and resources directories. However,
    it doesn't do any validation on the paths in the zip file. This means that a malicious
    user could craft a .kar file with ".." directory names and break out of the directories
    to write arbitrary content to the filesystem. This is the "Zip-slip" vulnerability
    - https://snyk.io/research/zip-slip-vulnerability. This vulnerability is low if
    the Karaf process user has limited permission on the filesystem. Any Apache Karaf
    releases prior 4.2.3 is impacted.
